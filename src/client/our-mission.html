                        Our mission is to prepare a hot meal, which can be served in the evening for anyone and everyone in the area. We have a <i> "no questions asked policy" </i>.
                         It is assumed that most children will have access to breakfast and lunch at school - either at reduced cost or even free of charge. 
                         So, the goal of our hot evening meals is to save the children and their whole family from going to bed hungry. 
                         Weekends and holidays can be especially difficult, so the soup kitchen operates <b>365 days a year</b>. 
                         The meals are prepared and packaged to carry out. Our doors are open to anyone.

                    <p>
                        The Rarden Daily Bread Inc. is led by Pamela Syroney and Thelma Shirey. 
                        They provide leadership, inspiration, and energy for the organization. 
                        However, Pamela and Thelma are not the only workers. In fact, they both are quick to say that Rarden Daily Bread’s mission relies on more folks than just the two of them. 
                        There is a large community of volunteers who have been preparing daily meals since their group began in 2020. 
                        They are doing an amazing job of fighting to end food insecurity in their community and the communities well beyond the 'borders' of Rarden.
