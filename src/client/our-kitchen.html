        <p class="centered-basic-text">
            Most of the food is supplied by The Freestore in Cincinnati, Ohio. Rarden Daily Bread volunteers drive a donated truck to pick up the supplies. 
            These same volunteers often use their own funds to purchase more food items to supplement the food they receive from The Freestore. 
            We also accept food donations from area companies and grocery stores. Each meal is packaged in carry-out containers, placed in a donated plastic grocery bag and made available for pick up by the individual at our location. 
            The number of meals prepared each evening are based on the food and ingredients that have been donated and purchased.

        </p>

        <p class="centered-basic-text">
            As an important bonus, families can pick up a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs, provided by The FreeStore one time each month. 
            We understand how helpful this is to families trying to fit food into their monthly budget.

            Our daily menu is created around the food available the current week. Meals are created around a daily theme or main entree, 
            and they range from homemade chili with peanut butter sandwiches, a fresh fruit, and dessert. To meals such as spaghetti, homemade vegetable soup, 
            salisbury steak, and any other nourishing hot meal that has found favor with their community. Most of our meals also include sides and desserts. 
            Any foods and fixings that might be left in the fridge then become part of the pot-luck dinner prepared each Sunday.
        </p>
        <p class="centered-basic-text">
            The menu is posted on The Daily Bread chat and on this website, so our community knows what is available. 
            We keep a close count of the number of meals served each evening to ensure that no person goes hungry and none of our food goes to waste.
